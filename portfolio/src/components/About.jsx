                    My first interest in Computer Science came in school when I was learning the basics of OOP in Java,
                    which opened me up to the fact that building applications was very attaintable. This
                    launched a drive to build different projects and solve various challenging problems. This led
                    me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London and my desire to gain experience in the field of Software Engineering.

                    My priority right now is building more complex and unique projects that can demostrate my skills and gain real world experience 
                    with internships and freelance work, while finishing my studies. The field I am most interested in is Web Development, as I am very interested in
                    building Full-Stack Web Applications, utilising skills in both Frontend and Backend. I am also trying to hone my skills with frequent  
                     <a href="https://github.com/alyosha-bar"> GitHub </a> contributions and constant personal projects.

                    My life outside of programming involves a lot of sports, as I am a member of my University Volleyball team. I also play
                    basketball socially in Uni every week.
